        # Theme Generation Task
        
        Generate 4 diverse and evocative themes for haiku poetry that will inspire exceptional verse.

        ## Theme Requirements
        Create themes that are:
        - Unusual and unexpected, avoiding clich√©d topics
        - Rich in sensory potential (visual, auditory, tactile imagery)
        - 2-4 words that immediately evoke a specific scene or feeling
        - Varied across different categories: nature phenomena, human emotions, abstract concepts, seasonal elements
        - Capable of inspiring both traditional and contemporary haiku approaches

        ## Quality Guidelines
        Each theme should spark vivid imagery and emotional resonance. 
        Aim for themes that a master haiku poet would find compelling and worthy of exploration.

        ## Examples
        Excellent themes: "morning frost patterns", "distant thunder", "forgotten photograph", "candle's final moment"

        ## Output Instructions
        Save the themes as global variables:
        - Save the first theme (focus on nature/seasons) to {{@theme_1}}
        - Save the second theme (focus on human emotion/experience) to {{@theme_2}}  
        - Save the third theme (focus on abstract/philosophical) to {{@theme_3}}
        - Save the fourth theme (focus on everyday objects/moments) to {{@theme_4}}
