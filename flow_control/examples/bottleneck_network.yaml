name: Bottleneck Network
description: Network with severe central bottleneck

nodes:
  s: source
  a: intermediate
  b: intermediate
  c: intermediate
  d: intermediate
  e: intermediate
  t: sink

edges:
  # Wide input
  e0: {from: s, to: a, capacity: 15.0}
  e1: {from: s, to: b, capacity: 12.0}
  
  # Converge to bottleneck
  e2: {from: a, to: c, capacity: 3.0}
  e3: {from: b, to: c, capacity: 3.0}
  
  # Severe bottleneck
  e4: {from: c, to: d, capacity: 2.0}
  e5: {from: c, to: e, capacity: 2.0}
  
  # Wide output
  e6: {from: d, to: t, capacity: 10.0}
  e7: {from: e, to: t, capacity: 8.0}
